problem set list.
compile from serveral books - 
also maybe not only math problems, do music problems, 
writing prompts (essays, standup), logic puzzles, 
programming puzzles, programming prompts, social/psychological 
problems and prompts, stretching and flexibility prompts.
 
what books to take problems from:
bpt - all sources i have.
concrete mathematics, scientific computing,
calculus - great book, 
linear algebra and related by strang,
networks by newman, ...

bayesian data analysis, the coursera courses,
the MIT guys book, 


for the fast paced calculations, look up easy 
systems that you can solve that actually matter.
ideas:
electrical networks
potential and kinetic energies
trigonometric relationships
heat transfer 
statics
chemical potential
electrical potential
reynolds numbers, nusselt, prandelt and relations
heats of combustion
permutations
concentrations, dilutions,...
batch times
center of mass for different objects.
inertia fun - torque
configurational entropy
mobility
angle of reflection
power output
cooling requirements

NETWORK METRICS
statistical expressions - binomial for certain inputs
bayesian update for certain scenario
counting and probability
radar range equation
distance, velocity, time
springs
youngs modulus
viscosity
electrical fields,
biot savart law
TAKE FROM PHYSICAL BIOLOGY OF THE CELL



again, i want to note that this is not 
the wild/abstract thinking, where i would 
propose ODEs for stuff - this is just quickly
getting a result. 

10min focus list.



new trello features.
- especially for social relations.
- regularily engaging with people,
  maintaining relationships, doing
  omeggle and chatroulette sessions
  to get to know people in different
  situations and walks of life. Write
  more emails to people you are inspired
  by. 



SE - practice
 - this is also related to omegle/chatroulette/discord
   discusssions. maybe also in person in cafe phoenix.
   

take Theo to stadtpark to climb trees.
laughter - LY - growing kindness core.
initiating things. actively influencing things.
starting things. setting them in motion. shaping the
world around you.
